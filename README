Instructions: (right now Tmobile is only really working for automatic attaching of emails.  Tmobile scraping will work for root or non root!)

Click button 1.  Determine if you have CIQ.
Click button 2 to search for profiles.
Click button 3 to copy profile to sdcard (required to attach to email)
Click button 4 to send email to EFF!  (be warned - archive.img MAY contain sensitive data.  EFF will always do its best to keep archive.img files confidential, but please DO NOT send them if there may be any private information on the handset you are working with)


Now - Lets make this more robust :)

Instructions: (right now HTC Evo line & Tmobile is only really working for automatic attaching of emails -- will work for root or non root!  Every model should be capiable of scanning for profiles if you are rooted!  We need more data so help out at form!)

Click button 1.  Determine if you have CIQ.
Click button 2 to search for profiles.
Click button 3 to copy profile to sdcard (required to attach to email)
Click button 4 to send email to EFF!  (be warned - archive.img (only, profiles are not sensitive) MAY contain sensitive data.  This archive could contain sensitive data, including location and call history, URLs, or text messages.  Do not send it to EFF if there may be private information on this handset.)


Now - Lets make this more robust :)
